// so a typo in the Windows syscall, or an import the fallback stopped using,
// ships and stays. The first person to find out is on that platform, watching
// this whole package fail to build: the other gates and verify
// all live in it, and none of them are about disks at all.

// expression covering a platform twice is a redefinition, one covering it
// nowhere is an undefined reference. The three expressions are complements
// maintained by hand — platform_nostatfs.go negates, name by name, the list
// platform_statfs.go declares — and nothing but this keeps them complementary.
