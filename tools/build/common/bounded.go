// boundedWriter is an io.Writer that keeps the first n bytes written to it
// and silently discards the rest. Write always returns len(p), nil, so a
// child process writing to it is never blocked or errored — the child's
// lifetime is governed by its context timeout, not by the reader stopping.

	buf []byte
	max int
	n   int // total bytes offered, including discarded
}
