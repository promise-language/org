// It refuses rather than being absent, and that is the whole point of the file:
// with no definition at all this package would not compile on those platforms,
// so nothing else in it — the other gates and verify — could be
// built there either. A refusal costs them `fit` and nothing more.
//
// It refuses rather than reporting a number, because there is no honest one. A
// zero would report a full disk on every such machine, and a large constant
// would report fitness that was never measured.
