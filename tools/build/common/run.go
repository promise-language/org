// Running one gate by hand, and reaching a verdict from what it measured.
//
// This is the judging layer, and it is a DIFFERENT PROGRAM from the gates on
// purpose. A gate that held its own thresholds could be made to pass by
// editing the gate — and when the thing being measured is a change written by
// an agent, the agent can edit it. The party under judgement must not hold
// what judges it.
//
// It is also the only layer that can render a result for a person: it holds
// the caps, so it can print a number beside the terms it was judged on. A gate
// could only ever print the left-hand column.
//
// It has TWO MODES, and the difference is who ran the gate:
//
//   - `run <gate>` measures and then judges. A person at a terminal, and no
//     decision rests on it — a result handed over by the measured party is a
//     claim, not a measurement.
//   - `run <gate> --verdict` judges an envelope it was GIVEN, on stdin, and
//     spawns nothing. This is the one the SDK asks, and it is what keeps the
//     SDK in the runner's seat: an entry point that ran the gate itself would
//     be the runner, and the runner may not come from the tree.
//
// Both reach the verdict through the same comparison, so they cannot disagree
// about what this project allows.
